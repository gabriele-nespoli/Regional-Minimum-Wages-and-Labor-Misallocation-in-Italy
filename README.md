# Regional-Minimum-Wages-and-Labor-Misallocation-in-Italy
Contains an automated Python workflow with Selenium to log into the commercial database Orbis via single sign-on (SSO), load a saved search by XPath, and export balance-sheet data on the desired firms firms in batches, with retries/timeouts, sequential file naming, resume support, and integrity checks.

This program was used to obtain the dataset for my bachelor thesis.

This repository will soon be updated to contain the replication package for my first paper "Regional Minimum Wages and Labor Misallocation in Italy", Bocconi Economic Journal, Issue 1, 2025.
